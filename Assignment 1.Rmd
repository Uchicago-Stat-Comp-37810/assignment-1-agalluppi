## Section 4.1.1

### Exercise 2
####(a)
```{r}
#Create an empty vector for the first 30 values of the Fibonacci sequence and set the first two values
fib <- vector(mode = "numeric", length = 30)
fib[1] = fib[2] <- 1

#Compute values of the Fibonacci vector
for (i in 3:30){
  fib[i] <- fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]  
}

#Create an empty vector for the ratios of the Fibonacci numbers and the previous Fibonacci number
fibRatios <- vector(mode = "numeric", length = 29)

#Compute the values of the Fibonacci ratios
for (i in 2:30) {
  fibRatios[i-1] <- fib[i]/fib[i-1]
}
print(fibRatios)
```
The values do appear to be converging.


####(b)
$$ (1+\sqrt5)/2 $$

```{r, echo = FALSE}
(1+sqrt(5))/2

```



### Exercise 3
####(a)

```{r}
answer <- 0
for (j in 1:5) answer <- answer + j
print(answer)

```

####(b)

```{r}
answer <- NULL
for (j in 1:5) answer <- c(answer, j)
print(answer)

```

####(c)

```{r}
answer <- 0
for (j in 1:5) answer <- c(answer, j)
print(answer)

```

####(d)

```{r}
answer <- 1
for (j in 1:5) answer <- answer * j
print(answer)

```

####(e)

```{r}
answer <- 3
for (j in 1:15) answer <- c(answer, (7 * answer[j]) %% 31)
print(answer)

```
Knowing nothing at all about the rule, I wouldn't have confidence guessing the next terms in the sequence; however, I was able to guess that the sequence repeated given the code above.
